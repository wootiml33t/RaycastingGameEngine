# RaycastingGameEngine
A raycasting engine built around the fundamentals presented by F. Permadi @permadi.com and sheeptheelectric @Instructables

This project aims to give the ability to create games with a level of abstraction to seperate the developer from the nuances of the mathematics involved in rendering and collision detection. While this is mainly going to be a fun side project for my self to help learn how this particular type of game engine works, I hope that maybe someone else can learn from my heavily noted code.

ToDo:
-Move the game map out of the Game class and into the Map class to allow for easier map management
-Fix forward collision detection
-Add ability to create billboard sprites
-Upload ingame images and textures

Note: Currently all textures must be square.
